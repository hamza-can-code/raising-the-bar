                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Payments run through Stripe Connect (a trusted payment platform). When someone buys through
                            your link, the money is split automatically based on your agreed percentage. You have your
                            own Stripe dashboard showing sales, payouts, refunds, and all transaction info, so you can
                            see everything clearly.</p>

                        <p>
                            No. Your followers see your brand — your colours, visuals, pages, and app.
                            Payments go through your connected Stripe account, so your name appears on the charge.
                            Our name only appears in legal pages like the terms, contact page, and footer.

                            We don’t treat launch as the finish line.
                            If sales aren’t immediate, we look at the data and make changes until it sells.
                            This is a proven system, and every partner we’ve worked with has made sales.

                        <p>You can do both. Monthly payments, one-time programs, upsells, bundles, or a hybrid — the app
                            and access rules can match whatever you want to sell.</p>

                        <p>No. If it’s not the right fit, you can stop after the launch phase. We want long-term
