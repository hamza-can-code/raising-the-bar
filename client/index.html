                        <p>We use Stripe Connect Express to handle all payments. When someone purchases through your
                            funnel, Stripe automatically splits revenue between us based on your agreed percentage —
                            instantly. You have your own Stripe dashboard showing live sales, payouts, refunds, and all
                            transaction data, so there’s zero reliance on us for reporting.</p>

                        <p>Your brand is front and centre — colors, tone, visuals, domain, offer page, and app UI. The

                            Ltd) so transactions are legally compliant. Everything customer-facing sits under your

                        <p>No risk. There are no upfront costs or retainers during launch. If performance isn’t there,
                            you can walk away. Our incentives are perfectly aligned with yours — we only earn if you do.
