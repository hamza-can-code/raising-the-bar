      <h3 class="page-heading with-badge-logo">Additional Advice</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Exercise</strong><br />
        Ensure that you are warmed up and stretched before your main resistance movements. Prior to your working sets,
        perform the movement with a light load for a few repetitions to prepare your body and mind, increase
        performance, and reduce the risk of injury. During the main sets, choose a challenging weight whilst maintaining
        correct form. Move the weights in a slow and controlled manner to maximise muscle stimulation and lessen the
        potential for injuries. Once you have finished your set, rest for for the recommended duration advised in your
        program before starting your next set. You should feel soreness and discomfort during your workout; however, if
        you ever feel sharp pain, stop and adjust — in the <strong>Pro Tracker</strong>, we suggest safe alternatives
        based on your
        equipment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Nutrition</strong><br />
        To sustain a healthy lifestyle, fuel your body with the right amount of calories, nutrients, and water. Focus on
        consistency rather than perfection — small, sustainable changes lead to long-term success. Tracking your food
        can be incredibly helpful. In the <strong>Pro Tracker</strong>, your meals are generated for you and matched to
        your macros,
        making things much simpler. While all nutrients matter, start by monitoring your calories and protein.
        Supplements can be useful, but they should support — not replace — a balanced, whole-food-based diet.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Recovery</strong><br />
        Recovery is just as important as training. To support muscle growth, reduce stress, and boost overall health,
        aim to eat well and sleep consistently — especially on rest days. A regular sleep routine makes a big
        difference: avoid food and screens an hour before bed, and keep your room cool and dark. You can take this
        further with a relaxing wind-down, like reading for 30 minutes followed by a short meditation. Aim for 7–9 hours
        of sleep each night — it’s the foundation for long-term progress.
