    <!-- 1. INTRODUCTION -->
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Raising The Bar App Ltd. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). These Terms of Service (the “Terms”)
      govern your access to and use of our web‑based fitness and nutrition platform, mobile features, digital products,
      and any related services (collectively, the “Service”). By creating an account, purchasing a plan, or otherwise
      using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a
        href="refund-policy.html">Refund & Cancellation Policy</a>, <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>,
      and any other policies we reference.</p>

    <!-- 2. ELIGIBILITY -->
    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>The Service is intended solely for individuals who are at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal majority in
      their jurisdiction. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement. If you do not,
      you must not attempt to register or use the Service under any circumstances.</p>

    <p>We rely on user representations of eligibility. If we learn that an account was created by someone under the
      required age, we may suspend or terminate access and, where appropriate, void the agreement from the date of
      discovery and arrange a refund consistent with applicable law.</p>

    <!-- 3. DEFINITIONS -->
    <h2>3. Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“Subscription”</strong> refers to a recurring, automatically renewing paid plan.
        This may be marketed as the <em>12-Week Plan</em> on our website and is billed as the
        <em>Pro Tracker</em> on your invoice/card statement (descriptor may appear as “RAISING THE BAR APP” or “Pro
        Tracker”).
        Both names describe the same service and grant access to premium features.
      </li>
      <!-- <li><strong>“One‑Time Program”</strong> means a fixed‑term digital product (e.g., 1‑Week, 4‑Week, or 12‑Week Plan) purchased for a single fee.</li> -->
      <li><strong>“Billing Cycle”</strong> means the monthly period for which subscription fees are charged in advance.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 4. SERVICES PROVIDED -->
    <h2>4. Services Provided</h2>
    <p>The Service includes tailored workout programming, nutrition planning, progress tracking, educational content,
      and community or support features. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service
      at any time with or without notice, provided such changes do not materially diminish the core value of any active
      paid plan.</p>

    <!-- 5. ACCOUNT SECURITY & ACCEPTABLE USE -->
    <h2>5. Account Security & Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide accurate, current, and complete information during sign‑up and keep it updated.</li>
      <li>Maintain the confidentiality of your login credentials. You are responsible for all activities under your
        account.</li>
      <li>Use the Service for personal, non‑commercial purposes. Reselling or redistributing our content is prohibited.
      </li>
      <li>Refrain from uploading malicious code, scraping data, or engaging in any activity that disrupts or harms the
        Service or other users.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 6. PURCHASES, BILLING & CANCELLATION -->
    <h2>6. Purchases, Billing & Cancellation</h2>
    <!-- <p><strong>6.1 One‑Time Programs.</strong> Fees are due in full at checkout and grant access only for the specified program length. No automatic renewal occurs.</p> -->
    <p><strong>6.2 Subscriptions.</strong> Subscriptions bill immediately at checkout and renew automatically each month
      until cancelled. By subscribing, you authorize us (and our payment processors) to charge your selected payment
      method on a recurring basis at the stated rate. We will notify you in advance of any future price changes, and
      such changes will apply from your next renewal.</p>



    <p><strong>6.3 Cancellation of Subscriptions.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cancel at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:info@raisingthebarapp.com"
          class="email">info@raisingthebarapp.com</a>.
        We’ll confirm your cancellation by email.</li>
      <li>Cancellations schedule your subscription to end at the next renewal date. You’ll continue to have full access
        until the end of your current billing cycle, and <strong>no further charges will occur after that
          point</strong>.</li>
      <li>No pro-rated refunds are provided for partial-month usage.</li>
      <li>Cancellations cannot be processed while a payment is overdue or an account balance remains unpaid. Any
        outstanding balance must be settled before cancellation takes effect.</li>
      <li>Charges already processed are final and non-refundable except as required by law or under our Money-Back
        Guarantee (see Refund & Cancellation Policy).</li>
      <li>Requests for information about how to cancel (e.g. asking for instructions) do not constitute a cancellation
        request.
        A subscription will only be considered cancelled once you explicitly instruct us to cancel, and we confirm your
        cancellation by email.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 7. REFUNDS -->
