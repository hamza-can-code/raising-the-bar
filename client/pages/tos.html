    <!-- 1. INTRODUCTION -->
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Raising The Bar App Ltd. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). These Terms of Service (the “Terms”)
      govern your access to and use of our web‑based fitness and nutrition platform, mobile features, digital products,
      and any related services (collectively, the “Service”). By creating an account, purchasing a plan, or otherwise
      using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a
        href="refund-policy.html">Refund & Cancellation Policy</a>, <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>,
      and any other policies we reference.</p>

    <!-- 2. ELIGIBILITY -->
    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>The Service is intended solely for individuals who are at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal majority in their jurisdiction. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement. If you do not, you must not attempt to register or use the Service under any circumstances.</p>

<p>We rely on user representations of eligibility. If we become aware that you are under the required age, or have otherwise misrepresented your eligibility, we may immediately terminate or suspend your account without notice. Any payments made by or on behalf of an underage user will not create a binding contract, and access to the Service will be revoked.</p>


    <!-- 3. DEFINITIONS -->
    <h2>3. Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“Subscription”</strong> means a recurring, automatically renewing paid plan that grants access to

      paid plan.</p>
