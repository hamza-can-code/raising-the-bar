    <!-- 1. SCOPE -->
    <h2>1. Scope&nbsp;and&nbsp;Acceptance</h2>
    <p>This policy governs all purchases—one‑time, subscription, promotional, or otherwise—made through
      Raising The Bar App Ltd. (the “<strong>Company</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>,” or
      “<strong>us</strong>”). By completing a purchase you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the
      terms below, which form a binding legal agreement in addition to our <a
        href="../pages/tos.html">Terms&nbsp;of&nbsp;Service</a>.</p>

    <!-- 2. MONEY‑BACK GUARANTEE -->
<h2>2. Money-Back Guarantee (where advertised)</h2>
<p>A Money-Back Guarantee applies <em>only</em> when expressly stated at checkout. To qualify for a full refund,
  <strong>all</strong> of the following requirements must be met:</p>
  <p><em>“Transaction date” is the date/time shown on your receipt/statement (UTC).</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A written request is emailed to <span class="email"><a href="mailto:info@raisingthebarapp.com">info@raisingthebarapp.com</a></span> within <span class="highlight">33&nbsp;calendar&nbsp;days</span> of the transaction date.</li>
  <li>You have used the platform for a minimum of <span class="highlight">30&nbsp;consecutive&nbsp;days</span> and can provide verifiable proof of meaningful engagement, including <strong>all</strong> of:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">≥ 20</span> unique workouts completed with logged sets, reps, and weights;</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">≥ 50</span> meals logged or swapped in the nutrition tracker;</li>
      <li>An unbroken activity streak of <span class="highlight">≥ 21&nbsp;days</span> visible in your account history;</li>
      <li>Upon request, screen recordings and/or screenshots demonstrating live interaction with program features (we may corroborate against IP/device/server analytics).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The request includes a clear, honest reason for dissatisfaction. <em>Fabricated, back-dated, or otherwise fraudulent evidence immediately voids eligibility.</em></li>
<li>If you encounter any access or functionality issues, you must report them to us during the guarantee period and provide basic details (e.g., screenshot or screen recordings). We will investigate using our system logs and error telemetry. If our logs confirm normal service and no reproducible fault is found, such issues will not qualify for a refund.</li>

<li>Only one Money-Back Guarantee claim is permitted per customer (household/device) within any 12-month period.</li>

<li>Your account must be in good standing with no overdue or unpaid balances at the time your refund is assessed.</li>

</ul>
<p>Refund determinations are made at our sole discretion and communicated within <span class="highlight">14&nbsp;business&nbsp;days</span> of receiving a complete request. Our decision is <strong>final</strong>.This does not affect your statutory rights.</p>
<p>Approved refunds are returned to the original payment method only. Processing times vary by provider, but we aim to issue approved refunds within 5–10 business days of approval.</p>

    <!-- 3. SUBSCRIPTIONS -->

  <li>No pro-rated refunds are provided for partial-week usage.</li>
  <li>Charges already processed are final and non-refundable except as required by law or where the Money-Back Guarantee (Section&nbsp;2) applies.</li>
</ul>
