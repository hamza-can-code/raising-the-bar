    <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: <span class="highlight">17 May 2025</span> &nbsp;|&nbsp; Last Updated: <span class="highlight">1 September 2025</span></p>

    <!-- 1. SCOPE -->
    <h2>1. Scope and Acceptance</h2>
    <p>This policy governs all purchases—one-time, subscription, promotional, or otherwise—made through Raising The Bar App Ltd. (the “<strong>Company</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”). By completing a purchase you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms below, which form a binding legal agreement in addition to our <a href="../pages/tos.html">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

    <!-- 2. MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE -->
    <h2>2. Money-Back Guarantee (where advertised)</h2>
    <p>A Money-Back Guarantee applies <em>only</em> when expressly stated at checkout. To qualify for a full refund, <strong>all</strong> of the following requirements must be met:</p>
    <p><em>“Transaction date” refers to the date/time shown on your receipt or payment statement (UTC).</em></p>
    <ul>
<li>A written request must be emailed to <span class="email"><a href="mailto:info@raisingthebarapp.com">info@raisingthebarapp.com</a></span> within <span class="highlight">45&nbsp;calendar&nbsp;days</span> of the transaction date.</li>
      <li>You have used the platform for a minimum of <span class="highlight">30 consecutive days</span> and can provide verifiable proof of meaningful engagement, including <strong>all</strong> of:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="highlight">≥ 20</span> unique workouts completed with logged sets, reps, and weights;</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">≥ 50</span> meals logged or swapped in the nutrition tracker;</li>
          <li>An unbroken activity streak of <span class="highlight">≥ 21 days</span> visible in your account history;</li>
          <li>Upon request, screen recordings and/or screenshots demonstrating live interaction with program features (we may corroborate with IP, device, or server analytics).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The request includes a clear, honest reason for dissatisfaction. <em>Fabricated, back-dated, or otherwise fraudulent evidence immediately voids eligibility.</em></li>
      <li>If you encounter any access or functionality issues, you must report them to us during the guarantee period and provide basic details (e.g., screenshots or screen recordings). We will investigate using our logs and telemetry. If our logs confirm normal service and no reproducible fault is found, such issues will not qualify for a refund.</li>
      <li>Only one Money-Back Guarantee claim is permitted per customer (household/device) within any 12-month period.</li>
      <li>Your account must be in good standing with no overdue or unpaid balances at the time your refund is assessed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Refund determinations are made at our sole discretion and communicated within <span class="highlight">14 business days</span> of receiving a complete request. Our decision is <strong>final</strong>. This does not affect your statutory rights.</p>
    <p>Approved refunds are returned to the original payment method only. Processing times vary by provider, but we aim to issue approved refunds within 5–10 business days of approval.</p>

    <!-- 3. SUBSCRIPTIONS -->
    <h2>3. Subscription Billing & Cancellations</h2>
    <p>Subscriptions renew automatically until cancelled. By subscribing, you agree to the following billing and cancellation terms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subscriptions are billed in advance on a recurring basis (weekly or monthly, depending on the plan selected).</li>
      <li>All cancellations must be requested by contacting our support team via email at <a href="mailto:info@raisingthebarapp.com">info@raisingthebarapp.com</a>. There are currently no in-app or self-service cancellation options.</li>
      <li>Cancellations schedule your subscription to end at the conclusion of your current billing cycle. You will retain full access to all premium features until that date, and no further charges will occur after the cycle ends.</li>
      <li>Cancellation requests submitted after a renewal charge has been processed will apply to the next billing cycle. No pro-rated or partial refunds are provided for remaining days or weeks within an active billing period.</li>
      <li>Charges already processed are final and non-refundable except as required by law or under the Money-Back Guarantee (Section 2).</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 4. NON-REFUNDABLE ITEMS -->
    <h2>4. Non-Refundable & Non-Transferable Purchases</h2>
    <p>Unless explicitly covered by Section 2 or required by law, all sales are deemed <span class="highlight">FINAL</span>. This includes but is not limited to:</p>

      <li>Failure to engage with the program or use the service as intended;</li>
