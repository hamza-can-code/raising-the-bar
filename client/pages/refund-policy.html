    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: <span class="highlight">17/05/2025</span></p>

    <h2>1. Money-Back Guarantee</h2>
    <p>If a "Money-Back Guarantee" was clearly offered at checkout, you may be eligible for a full refund provided the
      following conditions are met:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You submit a refund request to <span class="email">info@raisingthebarapp.com</span> within <span
          class="highlight">30 days</span> of your original purchase.</li>
      <li>You have actively followed the program or used the tracker for at least <span class="highlight">30 consecutive
          days</span>.</li>
      <li>Your request must include detailed evidence that demonstrates meaningful effort and usage of the platform.
        This includes:
        <ul>
          <li>At least 20 completed workouts with logged sets, reps, and weights.</li>
          <li>At least 50 meals logged or swapped within the nutrition tracker.</li>
          <li>A consistent activity streak of 3+ weeks, visible in your tracker history.</li>
          <li>We may also request screen recordings or usage logs showing you interacting with features like workout
            summaries, meal prep mode, or coach insights.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> We reserve the right to deny refund requests where there is evidence of minimal
        engagement, fabricated data, or intentional misuse of the refund policy.</p>
      <li>All refund requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. You will receive a decision within <span
          class="highlight">14 business days</span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Refunds will not be issued for:
    <ul>
      <li>Personal preferences (e.g., if you changed your mind or expected different results).</li>
      <li>Failure to use the service or follow the program as instructed.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Subscription Refunds</h2>
    <p>Subscriptions are billed monthly and renew automatically unless cancelled. Refunds for subscription payments will
      only be granted in exceptional cases and are not guaranteed. You are responsible for cancelling your subscription
      before the renewal date to avoid future charges.</p>

    <h2>3. General Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>Unless the above conditions are met or otherwise required by law, all purchases—whether one-time or
      subscription-based—are considered <span class="highlight">non-refundable</span> and <span
        class="highlight">non-transferable</span>.</p>

    <h2>4. EU Residents</h2>
    <p>If you reside in the EU, you may have the right to withdraw from this contract within <span class="highlight">14
        days</span> of purchase, provided you have not accessed or used the paid features of the platform. By starting
      your program or logging into the tracker, you waive your right to withdraw under EU consumer law.</p>
    <p>To exercise this right, email <span class="email">info@raisingthebarapp.com</span> with proof of purchase and a
      clear statement of your intention to withdraw.</p>

    <h2>5. How to Request a Refund</h2>
    <p>If you believe you're eligible for a refund, please email <span class="email">info@raisingthebarapp.com</span>
      with the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your full name and the email used for purchase</li>
      <li>Proof of purchase (e.g., confirmation email or receipt)</li>
      <li>Details and evidence of your platform usage or program adherence</li>
      <li>Your reason for requesting a refund</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We reserve the right to request additional clarification or documentation before approving a refund.</p>
