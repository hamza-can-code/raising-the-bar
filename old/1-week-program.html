      <p>
        <strong>Exercise</strong><br/>
        Ensure that you are warmed up and stretched before your main resistance movements. Prior to your working sets, perform the movement with a light load for a few repetitions to prepare your body and mind, increase performance, and reduce the risk of injury. During the main sets, choose a challenging weight whilst maintaining correct form. Move the weights in a slow and controlled manner to maximise muscle stimulation and lessen the potential for injuries. Once you have finished your set, rest for for the recommended duration advised in your program before starting your next set. You should feel soreness and discomfort during your workout; however, if you feel pain during your workout, please try suggested alternative exercises or contact us: support@raisingthebarcoaching.co.uk for additional help.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Nutrition</strong><br/>
        In order to sustain a healthy lifestyle, you must provide your body with the correct amount of calories, nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and water. Focus on consistency with nutrition rather than perfection, as small, sustainable changes lead to long-term success. Keeping a journal or using an app such as MyFitnessPal is an excellent method to track food intake. Although everything you feed your body is important, the two main components to track are your caloric and protein intake. Supplements can be very useful; they are not replacements for whole foods but can be used to complement a balanced diet.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Recovery</strong><br/>
        Recovery is just as crucial as training. To enhance recovery, promote muscle growth, reduce stress, and boost overall health, ensure you eat and sleep adequately every day, especially on rest days. Establishing a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding food and screens an hour before bed, and maintaining a cool, dark sleep environment can significantly improve sleep quality. Taking this a step further, incorporating a relaxing bedtime routine, such as reading a book for30-40 minutes followed by a 10-minute meditation session, can also be highly beneficial. You should be aiming to get 7-9 hours of sleep every night.
